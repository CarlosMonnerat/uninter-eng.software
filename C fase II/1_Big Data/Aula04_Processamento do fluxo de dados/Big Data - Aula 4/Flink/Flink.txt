What is Flink?
 - German for quick and nimble
 - Another stream processing engine - most similar to Storm
 - Can run on standalone cluster, or on top of YARN or Mesos
 - Highly scalable (1000's of nodes)
 - Fault tolerant
   - Can survive failures shile still guaranteeing exactly-once processing
   - Uses "state snapshots" to archieve this
 - Up & coming quickly

Flink vs. Spark Streaming vs. Storm
 - Flink's faster than Storm
 - Flink offers "real streamming" like Storm but if you're using Trident with Storm, you're using micro-batches)
 - Flink offers a higher-level API like Trident or Spark, but while still doing real-time streamming
 - Flink has a good Scala support, like Spark Streaming
 - Flink has an ecosystem of its own, like spark
 - Flink can process data based on event time, not when data was received
   - Impressive windowing system
   - This plus real-time streaming and exactly-once semantics is important for financial applications
 - But it's the youngest os the technologies

All three are converging it seems
 - Spark Streaming's "Structured Streaming" paves the way for real event-based streaming in Spark
 - Becomes more a question of what fits best in your existing environment

Flink architecture
 - DataStream API
 - DataSet API

Connectors
 - HDFS
 - Cassandra
 - Kafka
 - Others
   - Elasticseearch, NiFi, Redis, RabbitMQ, ...


Exemplo utilizando Flink: Contador de palavras

Instalando Flink:
 - wget https://downloads.apache.org/flink/flink-1.10.1/flink-1.10.1-bin-scala_2.11.tgz
 - tar -xzf flink-1.10.1-bin-scala_2.11.tgz
 - cd flink-1.10.1/
 - cd conf
 - vi flink-conf.yaml
jobmanager.web.port: 8082
 - cd ../
 - ./bin/start-local.sh
# Starting jobmanager daemon on host sandbox.hortonworks.com.
 - Acessar a interface web: 127.0.0.1:8082
 - Executar o código:
 - ./bin/flink run examples/streaming/SocketWindowWordCount.jar --port 9000
 - É possível observar a execução na interface web
 - Agora é a hora de alimentar a aplicação com palavras:
 - nc -l 9000
Aqui vão as palavras que serão escritas (pensar em algum textinho engraçado)
 - Você pode observar os resultados em:
 - cat log/flink-maria_dev-jobmanager-0-sandbox.hortonworks.com.out
